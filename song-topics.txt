brain diversity / ADD
people thinking you are weird
the randomness of life
I'm sorry for what I said
rats in the walls
Grandma's macaroons
waking in the night
the ocean / the beach
anxiety
stop breaking into my car
getting beaten up
boarding school
avoiding sport
walking the dog
learning Welsh
Being crap at being a musician
losing control
drinking habits
chasing a buzz
video games are pointless
brew day
cheek-biting
going to the museum
going to the movies
going to the amusement arcade
making a curry
friends who disappear
Can I have a job?
